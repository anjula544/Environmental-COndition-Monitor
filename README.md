This project involves designing an Environmental Parameter Monitoring System using ESP32 with enhanced functionalities, including Wi-Fi-based real-time data transmission, remote monitoring via a mobile app, and cloud storage for historical data analysis. The system measures temperature, humidity, air quality, and light intensity, displaying real-time data on an LCD and logging it to both an SD card and a cloud database. When the air quality level reaches the given threshold, a buzzer and an LED are triggered to alert that the air is polluted.
